# terraform

These are some basic terraform configs I have created. 

They all create a VPC with Internet Gateways, Public and Private subnets and appropriate Security Groups.

Specifically, others are tailored towards creating launch configs and auto-scalers, prometheus and dontstarvetogether game servers.
